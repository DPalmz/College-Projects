State of Project:
I started with code I took from 
https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/
then started adapting it to fit the shape of the existing code. I probably did myself a disservice by doing so. I ran into many problems
just from the fact that the code I was using looped in the fuctions instead of the main program. I think I did learn some from digging
through all those functions to try and get them to work, but I still would have been better off trying to make my own.


In the end, I never got it to work, still bug hunting. And I'm pretty sure even if I sucessfully got it to actually run, it wouldn't converge properly. 
Last bug tried to solve was in function "backprop," trying to solve some mismatched arrays for some math.
